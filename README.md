# CIFAR-10 image classification

This project is a part of Deep Learning course at CentraleSupelec

## Project description
Self-built networks (based on popular deep learning network architectures such as VGG, Resnet, ...) were applied on CIFAR-10 dataset to predict the class of the image. CIFAR-10 contain 60,000 images of size 32x32. Each image belongs to 1 out of 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, trip, truck). The evaluation metric is accuracy score.  


The task was to employ deep learning to segment and classify the objects (26 labels) in the satellite images. The dataset comprises 374 images (3x3000x4000) of residential neighborhoods in Houston after the hurricane Harvey. 299 out of the total images have corresponding masks which were used for training deep learning models. The competition requires the submission of the masks for the remaining 75 images. The evaluation metric is dice score. A snapshot of the images and provided masks are as followed:
