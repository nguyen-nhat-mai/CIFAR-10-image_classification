# CIFAR-10 image classification

This project is a part of Deep Learning course at CentraleSupelec

## Project description
The mission is to build and try networks (based on popular deep learning network architectures such as VGG, Resnet, ...) on [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) to predict the class of the image. The popular CIFAR-10 contain 60,000 images of size 32x32. Each image belongs to 1 out of 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, trip, truck). The evaluation metric is accuracy score. A snapshot into the data is as followed:

## Pre-processing and exploration

## Modelling
Popular networks are used:

*1. VGG16*

Evaluation metrics used are:
- Accuracy score = # image correctly labeled / # image (100% means all the predicted labels are correct)
- Cross entrophy loss =
